Fake News Detection in Python

In this project, wI have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classifty fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1. Python 3.6 
   - This setup requires that your machine has python 3.6 installed on it. you can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once you have python downloaded and installed, you will need to setup PATH variables (if you want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in *how to run software section*). To do that check this: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/.  
   - Setting up PATH variable is optional as you can also run program without it and more instructon are given below on this topic. 
2. Second and easier option is to download anaconda and use its anaconda prompt to run the commands. To install anaconda check this url https://www.anaconda.com/download/
3. You will also need to download and install below 3 packages after you install either python or anaconda from the steps above
   - Sklearn (scikit-learn)
   - numpy
   - scipy
   
  - if you have chosen to install python 3.6 then run below commands in command prompt/terminal to install these packages
   ```
   pip install -U scikit-learn
   pip install numpy
   pip install scipy
   ```
   - if you have chosen to install anaconda then run below commands in anaconda prompt to install these packages
   ```
   conda install -c scikit-learn
   conda install -c anaconda numpy
   conda install -c anaconda scipy
   ```   

#### Dataset used
The data source used for this project is LIAR dataset which contains  train.csv. Below is some description about the data files used for this project.
	
LIAR: A BENCHMARK DATASET FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION

William Yang Wang, "Liar, Liar Pants on Fire": A New Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection, to appear in Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017), short paper, Vancouver, BC, Canada, July 30-August 4, ACL.

To make things simple we have chosen only 2 variables from this original dataset for this classification. The other variables can be added later to add some more complexity and enhance the features.

Below are the colomns used to create 3 datasets that have been in used in this project
* Column 1: Statement (News headline or text).
* Column 2: Label (Label class contains: True, False)
 
You will see that newly created dataset has only 2 classes as compared to 6 from original classes. Below is method used for reducing the number of classes.

* Original 	--	New
* True	   	--	True
* Mostly-true	-- 	True
* Half-true	-- 	True
* Barely-true	-- 	False
* False		-- 	False
* Pants-fire	-- 	False

The dataset used for this project were in csv format named train.csv, test.csv and valid.csv and can be found in repo. The original datasets are in "liar" folder in tsv format.

### Next steps
As we can see that our best performing models had an f1 score in the range of 70's. This is due to less number of data that we have used for training purposes and simplicity of our models. For the future implementations, we could introduce some more feature selection methods such as POS tagging, word2vec and topic modeling. In addition, we could also increase the training data size. We will extend this project to implement these techniques in future to increase the accuracy and performance of our models.
